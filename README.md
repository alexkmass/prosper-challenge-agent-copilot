# Prosper Challenge — Agent Composer

Voice AI for healthcare scheduling. An agent is a **graph of nodes** (Pipecat Flows), defined declaratively as JSON and compiled into a runnable voice pipeline.

- **Phase 1** — a UI to edit the node graph and place a test call.
- **Phase 2** — an AI Composer that generates and iterates on agents from natural language.

```
browser mic  ->  ElevenLabs STT  ->  OpenAI LLM  ->  ElevenLabs TTS  ->  browser
```

Pipecat's dev runner ships a **prebuilt browser client**, so the test-call UI comes for free — no frontend code to write yet.

## Quickstart

Requires **Python 3.11+**. Run from the repo root:

```bash
make install
make run
```

Open the URL it prints (default `http://localhost:7860/client`), click **Connect**, allow mic access, and talk to the agent. `Ctrl+C` to stop. (`make help` lists all targets.)\
\
Remember to update the `.env` file accordingly.

## Layout

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `backend/bot.py` | The voice pipeline (WebRTC + ElevenLabs STT/TTS + OpenAI LLM). Loads an agent JSON via `AgentBuilder` and runs it. No graph logic lives here. |
| `backend/agent_builder/` | All agent-building code. `schema.py` = the declarative `AgentConfig` / `Node` / `Edge` contract; `builder.py` = `AgentBuilder`, which loads + validates the JSON and compiles it into a Pipecat Flows graph. |
| `backend/example_flow.json` | The example agent **as data** — a clinic scheduler. The artifact the Phase 2 Composer generates/edits. |

To run a different agent, point `AGENT_FLOW` in `bot.py` at another JSON file.
